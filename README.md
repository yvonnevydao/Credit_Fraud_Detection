## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and protect customers. This project explores various machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. We compare the performance of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to determine the most effective approach.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 cases of fraud. The features include transaction time, amount, and anonymized variables.

**Preprocessing Steps:**
- Data cleaning
- Normalization of features
- Handling imbalanced classes
