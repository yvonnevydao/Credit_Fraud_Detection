## Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and protect customers. 

## Data Understanding

### Data Collection (Source)
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, and also available in Kaggle: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). 
- It contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 cases of fraud.
- The features include transaction time, amount, and anonymized variables.

#### Objective
This project explores various machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. 
- We **compare the performance** of **supervised** and **unsupervised learning techniques** to determine the most effective approach.

**Preprocessing Steps:**
- Load the dataset
- Data Types
- Class Distribution
